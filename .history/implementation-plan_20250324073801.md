# Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for new features in the AI chat application, including image upload, file upload, mobile responsiveness improvements, UI enhancements, code block features, and speech-to-text integration.

## Feature Implementation Details

### 1. Image Upload Feature

#### Components

- `ImageUploadDialog`: Pop-up dialog for image upload
- `ImageThumbnail`: Displays uploaded image preview in chat input
- Base64 conversion toggle switch
- Remove (X) button for thumbnails

#### Flow

```mermaid

    participant U as User
    participant D as Dialog
    participant T as Thumbnail
    participant I as Input Box
    
    U->>D: Click Upload Image
    D->>D: Show Upload Dialog
    U->>D: Select Image
    D->>D: Preview Image
    U->>D: Toggle Base64 Option
    U->>D: Click Submit
    D->>T: Add Thumbnail
    T->>I: Attach to Input Context
    U->>T: Can Click X to Remove
```

### 2. File Upload System

#### Components

- `FileUploadDialog`: Main upload interface
- `FileHistoryDialog`: Shows previously uploaded files
- File storage and retrieval system

#### Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as User
    participant D as Upload Dialog
    participant H as History Dialog
    participant S as Storage
    
    U->>D: Open File Upload
    D->>D: Show Upload UI
    U->>D: Select File
    D->>S: Store File Reference
    U->>H: View History
    H->>S: Fetch Past Files
    H->>U: Display File List
    U->>H: Select Historical File
```

### 3. Mobile Responsiveness

#### Improvements

- Dynamic viewport sizing
- Flexible container layouts
- Fixed input positioning
- Responsive component scaling

#### Layout Structure

```mermaid

    A[Viewport Settings] --> B[Dynamic Layout]
    B --> C[Flexible Container]
    C --> D[Auto-height Chat Area]
    D --> E[Fixed Position Input]
    
    F[Media Queries] --> G[Breakpoint Handling]
    G --> H[Component Scaling]
    H --> I[Input Accessibility]
```

### 4. Code Block Enhancement

#### Features

- Syntax highlighting
- Copy button
- Live editing capability
- Streaming code updates

#### Flow

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant AI as AI Model
    participant CB as Code Block
    participant U as User
    
    AI->>CB: Generate Code
    CB->>CB: Format & Highlight
    CB->>CB: Add Copy Button
    U->>CB: Edit Code
    CB->>CB: Live Update
    U->>CB: Copy Code
```

### 5. UI Improvements

- Larger model selection text
- Enhanced header styling
- Improved responsive design

### 6. Speech to Text Integration

- Real-time dictation to input box
- Visual feedback during recording
- Error handling
- Status indicators
